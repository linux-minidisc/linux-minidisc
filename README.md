# minidisc-ffwd: friendly fork, wip development

A friendly fork of `linux-minidisc` to more freely experiment
with things with less friction while eventually getting most
changes merged back into the upstream repository.

[Upstream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_(software_development)) repos and relationships:

```
    (o) Original Upstream Repo ("upstream")
     |  https://github.com/linux-minidisc/linux-minidisc
     |
    (o) NetMD fixes by vuori (upstream PR#62)
     |  https://github.com/vuori/linux-minidisc
     |
    (o) Downstream repo w/ fixes, used by Platium MD (upstream PR#82)
     |  https://github.com/gavinbenda/linux-minidisc
     |
  > (o) This Repo
     |  https://github.com/thp/linux-minidisc
     |
     v
```

Ideally all those changes will eventually find their way back into the
upstream repo, but for now, this faster-moving branch is where it's at.

README of the vuori fork is [here](README.vuori).
Original README of upstream is [here](README).
