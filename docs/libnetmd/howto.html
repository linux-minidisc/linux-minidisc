    <h1>So you want to reverse engineer a USB protocol</h1>

	<p>
	  So you bought the new fancy (insert device here) and it's all USB
	  capable n stuff. Problem is (company name here) doesn't support
	  your OS, and no one is working on software for it so you can't
	  just sit back and wait.</p> <p>No problem you say, I'm a
	  hard-core (insert OS name here) user, I can make my own
	  stuff.</p> <p>Good for you, now lets get down to work.</p>

	  <h2>Getting set up</h2> 

	<p>If you're rich, have a sugar
	  daddy/momma who is, or have a good company budget on your side
	  the way to go is to have a dedicated machine running one of the
	  supported OS's and have a hardware/software combo bus and
	  protocol analyzer like the one from <a
	  href="http://www.catc.com/products/chief.html">CATC</a>.</p>

	<p>On the other hand if you're a person of moderate income, cheap
	  or for whatever reason something like this is not an option, a
	  few guys came to your rescue and produced <a
	  href="http://www.wingmanteam.com/usbsnoopy/">USB Snoopy</a>. A software
	  based decoder that works for most versions of Microsoft
	  Windows.</p>

	<p>The next problem for some people is getting something set up to
	  run the supported OS. If you do not have dedicated hardware for
	  this one solution is <a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare
		Workstation</a><p>

	<P>VMWare allows you to run an Operating System
	  inside of a virtual machine which shows up as a window in your
	  current Operating System. The cost is somewhat prohibitive at
	  300 USD, and that of course does not include a license for the
	  needed OS.</P>

	<P>2 open source solutions may be viable, however I have not tested
	  them. <a href="http://www.plex86.org">Plex86</a> and 
	  <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/">Bochs</a>.</p>

	<p>Bochs is the only solution for someone running non Intel
	  compatible hardware and needs to run Microsoft Windows or other
	  Intel based OS, as Bochs
	  is a emulator not a hardware virtualizer (I'm not prepared to go
	  into the difference, however the latter uses the existing
	  hardware while the former pretends it IS hardware).</P>

	<p>Plex86 recently moved so the 
	  <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org">Savannah project management
		site</a>. It takes a more VMWare based virtualization approach
	  from what I understand. The project is closely related to Bochs
	  and they share code/have a similar user interface.</p>

	<h2>OK, I'm running the OS and have a way of getting the USB
	  data.</h2> 

	<p>Any examples I give have the assumption that you chose VMWare
	  and USB Snoopy as that's what I'm using.</p>

	<p>What you need to do is get your protocol analyzer in place and
	  ready to capture, then install the driver/software that drives
	  the USB device. After that you need to break down the
	  capabilities of the device that you are interested in. Rank
	  these capabilities in terms of how easy you think they will be
	  to figure out. Remember, baby steps. Not only will small
	  successes bolster your ego and drive to keep going, but it will
	  get you familiar with the protocol that you are dealing
	  with.</p>

	<p>Some protocols are well put together, simple to understand and
	  are easy to work with. You will probably never see one of these
	  protocols as they are like many other mythical things, often
	  talked about, never seen.</p>

	<p>Now we begin, with everything in place start up the software
	  that will talk to the device, the logger should be
	  running. When the software has finished starting up if it
	  communicated with the device you should have data, some software
	  polls different status information on the device while running,
	  if this is true you should see patterns in the data and pulses
	  going down the USB port (a nice thing about VMWare is the icon
	  that represents the USB port will flash to show data). Stop the
	  logger, save the data using a name like applicationstartup.log
	  or whatever and move down your list a couple of times getting
	  different data samples to work with, nothing complex just 2 or 3
	  different samples to compare.</p>

	<p>An understanding of the URB format is critical at this point,
	  an URB is the basic structure for every USB request (URB stands
	  for USB Request Block), its not an overly complex structure so
	  take a minute to review it</p>

	<p>This is where a bad protocol gets frustrating, the data looks
	  like garbage, the analyzer probably saves everything in hex
	  making life even harder when trying to deal with simple
	  text. Using hex is good however, because binary data wouldn't
	  look like much and hex is portable across platforms and
	  languages.</p>

	<p>If you will be dealing with simple text I have 
	  <a href="http://gargoyles.monochromatic.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/netmd">some
	source</a> which takes in chars and outputs hex, and takes in hex
	and output's simple printable chars or .'s</p>

	<p>From here every protocol is different, things to look for and
	  take notes on are Request #'s Index #'s and of course Value,
	  which is the binary data. Transfer flags and URBLink's may also
	  come into play on your device, URBLinks connect URB's
	  together.</p>

	<p>A few sample protocol spec's that can be found on the web are
	  the one for the <a
						 href="http://rio500.sourceforge.net/rio_protocol.html">Rio500</a>
	  and the one I'm working on for 
	  <a
		 href="http://gargoyles.monochromatic.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/netmd">Sony's NetMD Minidisc products.</a>
