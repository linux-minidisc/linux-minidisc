		<h3><a name="header">Header layout</a></h3>
		The way Sony implemented groups is interesting, its a text string stored with the disc name.<P>
		So if you had a MD with the Title GroovyMix and 2 groups Thumpen and Bumpen it could look like this:<BR>
		0;GroovyMix//1-5;Thumpen//6-8;Bumpen//
		
		Where 1-5 and 6-8 are the NON zero based track numbers that the group contains. 
		I ephasize non because the protocol refers to all track numbers in a zero based manner, making information tracking interesting<P>
